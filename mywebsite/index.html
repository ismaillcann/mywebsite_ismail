            <li>
              <strong>Practice Everyday</strong>
              <ul>
              
                  Spend at least an hour each day for coding. Because coding requires as much effort as learning a new
                  foreign language. Moreover, the more you practice, it is easier to learn. Beginners often say they
                  spend time on this job 2 days a week. Of course, the more often you practice, the faster you will
                  progress. If you started this way, you will realize how easily you learn when you code every day. If
                  you say that you want to spend time physically and learn face to face, it will be beneficial for you
                  to participate in software bootcamps.

              <li>
                <strong>Communicate with other software developers</strong>
                <ul>
                 Making software can isolate you from the outside world. You may have to sit and focus at the computer for hours. It will be very useful to contact an experienced software developer where you are stuck. So how do we reach these experienced software developers? 
 You can attend hackathons and workshops organized in your city or online. If you do not have the opportunity to participate, you can communicate with people of your interests and listen to their experiences on online platforms and forums.

                <strong>Generate ideas that will make your life easier</strong>
                <ul>
                  Coding is a broad field for generating new ideas. You can easily produce solutions to problems that tire you in your daily life with software. Due to our human nature, we do not like to do things that tire us. Our rate of making mistakes while doing strenuous work is also increasing. The most enjoyable part of learning coding is to solve these problems easily and with fewer errors.

              <li>
                <strong>Choose the most suitable programming language</strong>
                <ul>
                  The basics of the software can be learned, but after the first steps, you need to decide which area to make software. There are many different software languages in the world and the usage areas of each can be separated from each other. If you have trouble making decisions, don’t worry, everyone generally has a hard time choosing a programming language. The most important issue when learning a programming language is what you want. If you want to become a software developer and work in a short time, it will be beneficial for you to learn the programming languages preferred by the companies.
Those who are new to the software world generally prefer to learn software languages such as Javascript, Python and Ruby. After examining multiple different languages, you can choose the language closest to you and proceed on that path.
